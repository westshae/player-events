# Player-events minecraft plugin
## Brief introduction
This plugin was created to learn about the minecraft "events" system, so I would send a message to chat based on certain events.

For example, messages would be sent if players entered/left a bed, changed worlds or killed certain mobs, specifcally bosses. This plugin was a very quick project, which taught me about events as well as sending messages to players.
